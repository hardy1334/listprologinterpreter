# List Prolog Interpreter

List Prolog Interpreter is an interpreter for a different version of Prolog that is in list format, making it easier to generate List Prolog programs. This interpreter is an algorithm that parses and runs List Prolog code. I wrote the interpreter in SWI-Prolog.

# Getting Started

Please read the following instructions on how to install the project on your computer for writing code.

# Prerequisites

None

# Installing

* Download the repository to your machine.
In the SWI-Prolog environment, enter:
['listprolog'].    

* Running the tests
To run all tests, enter:
test(off,NTotal,Score).

To run a specific test:
test1(off,TestNumber,Passed).
where TestNumber is the test number from lpiverify4.pl.

Example of an end to end test
The query test1(off,1,Passed).
tests the following predicate:
test(1,[[n,function],[1,1,[v,c]]],
[
        [[n,function],[[v,a],[v,b],[v,c]],":-",
        [
                [[n,+],[[v,a],[v,b],[v,c]]]
        ]
        ]
]
,[[[v,c], 2]]).

This query contains the query tested, the predicate and the required result.

Also, the query test1(off,7,Passed).

test(7,[[n,reverse],[[1,2,3],[],[v,l]]],
[
        [[n,reverse],[[],[v,l],[v,l]]],
        [[n,reverse],[[v,l],[v,m],[v,n]],":-",
        [       [[n,head],[[v,l],[v,h]]],
                [[n,tail],[[v,l],[v,t]]],
                [[n,wrap],[[v,h1],[v,h]]],
                [[n,append],[[v,h1],[v,m],[v,o]]],
                [[n,reverse],[[v,t],[v,o],[v,n]]]
        ]
        ]
],[[[v,l], [3, 2, 1]]]).

tests the reverse predicate.
